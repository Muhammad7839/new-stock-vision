<!-- Stock Vision Project Notes
	1.	Main Project Folder
/Users/muhammad/Development/Stock-Vision
	2.	Backend Folder
/Users/muhammad/Development/Stock-Vision/backend
	3.	Cleaned Data Location
/Users/muhammad/Development/Stock-Vision/archive/cleaned_financial_data
	4.	Final Output Files
	•	Training: /Users/muhammad/Development/Stock-Vision/archive/financial_data/final_training_data.csv
	•	Testing: /Users/muhammad/Development/Stock-Vision/archive/financial_data/final_testing_data.csv
	5.	Python Script to Generate Final Files
Path: backend/finalize_data.py
	6.	Notebook for EDA
Path: backend/EDA.ipynb
	7.	How to Run the Finalization Script

cd backend
python finalize_data.py


	8.	Common Errors and Fixes
	•	If “No such file or directory”: check that the archive and financial_data folders exist.
	•	If the training file has 0 rows: check if dropna() is removing all data. Consider removing or adjusting it.
	9.	Loading Data in Jupyter Notebook

import pandas as pd
train_df = pd.read_csv('../archive/financial_data/final_training_data.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('../archive/financial_data/final_testing_data.csv')


	10.	What Was Fixed

	•	Dropped dropna() from finalize_data.py to keep rows with missing values.
	•	Made sure the correct relative paths are used.
	•	Confirmed training data now has 17685 rows.

	Perfect ✅ Your project structure is now clean, organized, and ready for the next steps. Here’s a breakdown of what’s important and what to keep in mind going forward:

✅ Important Folders and Their Purpose

Folder/Path	Purpose
archive/cleaned_financial_data/	Individual cleaned CSV files per year (used as input for final dataset)
archive/financial_data/	Final training and testing datasets (final_training_data.csv, etc.)
backend/	All backend logic including data prep, EDA, ML models, and scripts
backend/EDA.ipynb	Main notebook for EDA and model analysis
backend/finalize_data.py	Combines yearly cleaned data into training/testing sets
backend/clean_data.py	Used to clean raw yearly data
backend/model/	Python files for price & sentiment prediction models
frontend/	Simple UI (index.html, script.js, style.css)
README.md	Project overview
personal notes/	Your saved instructions or notes


⸻

🧾 Important Files to Remember

File Path	Use / Info
archive/financial_data/final_training_data.csv	Final training data — used for ML model training
archive/financial_data/final_testing_data.csv	Final testing data — used for evaluating model performance
backend/EDA.ipynb	Use this for all EDA, data loading, charts, insights, and analysis
backend/finalize_data.py	Rerun this to regenerate training/testing data if source changes
backend/requirements.txt	Use this to set up your Python environment with pip install -r
y_pred.npy, y_test.npy	Prediction output files for evaluation or plotting

🗂️ Where to Store Notes So You Don’t Forget

I suggest creating a simple reference file to store all of this. Name it:

📄 personal notes/Project_Reference.txt

Here’s a clean starter you can paste into that file:

Project: Stock-Vision
Last Updated: June 26, 2025

Working Directory:
- /Users/muhammad/Development/Stock-Vision/

Key Paths:
- Cleaned yearly files: archive/cleaned_financial_data/
- Final datasets: archive/financial_data/final_training_data.csv
- Main notebook: backend/EDA.ipynb
- Data finalization script: backend/finalize_data.py
- Model scripts: backend/model/
- Frontend files: frontend/

Virtual Environment:
- backend/venv/

To regenerate training/testing data:
$ python backend/finalize_data.py

To start EDA:
Open backend/EDA.ipynb and run:
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.read_csv('archive/financial_data/final_training_data.csv')

Always use relative paths from the root (Stock-Vision/) or from backend/ if inside the notebook.

Notes:
- Avoid using backend/archive — it’s just a duplicate folder now.
- Archive.zip was deleted.


Project: Stock-Vision

	•	Final datasets: archive/financial_data/final_training_data.csv
	•	Final test set: archive/financial_data/final_testing_data.csv

	•	ML Model scripts: backend/model/
	•	Frontend files: frontend/
	•	Notes: personal notes/

Virtual Environment:
	•	backend/venv/

How to Regenerate Final Training/Testing Data:
	1.	Navigate to project root:
cd /Users/muhammad/Development/Stock-Vision/
	2.	Run the data finalization script:
python backend/finalize_data.py

Notebook Data Loading:
Use this inside backend/EDA.ipynb:

import pandas as pd
train_df = pd.read_csv('archive/financial_data/final_training_data.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('archive/financial_data/final_testing_data.csv')

Important Reminders:
	•	Always confirm the notebook is running in the correct working directory (backend/)
	•	Only use archive/financial_data/ for finalized CSVs
	•	Avoid using backend/archive — it was a duplicate
	•	archive.zip was deleted after extraction
	•	All extra or old copies of training/testing CSVs were removed
	•	Use relative paths in notebook and script references

Good Practices:
	•	If cleaned yearly files are updated, re-run finalize_data.py
	•	Avoid using dropna() directly unless you’re sure
	•	Keep track of rows/columns in all transformations

train_df = pd.read_csv('../archive/financial_data/final_training_data.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('../archive/financial_data/final_testing_data.csv')
